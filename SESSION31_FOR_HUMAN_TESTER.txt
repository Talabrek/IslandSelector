=================================================
EDGE CASES TO TEST
=================================================

1. Empty Slot Right-Click:
   - Player has slot 2 available but empty
   - Right-click slot 2
   - Should show: "This slot is empty! Create an island first..."

2. Locked Slot Right-Click:
   - Slot 3 is locked (no permission)
   - Right-click slot 3
   - Should show: "This slot is locked! You cannot view settings..."

3. Multiple Slots:
   - Open settings for slot 1
   - Go back, open settings for slot 2
   - Each should show correct data

4. Active vs Inactive:
   - Right-click active slot
   - Preview shows "✔ Currently Active"
   - Right-click inactive slot
   - Preview shows "Inactive"

=================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================================================

Files Created:
+ SlotSettingsGUI.java (NEW - settings menu GUI)

Files Modified:
+ SlotSelectionGUI.java (added right-click detection)

GUI Layout:
- 27 slots (3 rows × 9 columns)
- Slot 4: Preview (center of row 1)
- Slot 11: Rename button (NAME_TAG)
- Slot 13: Change Icon button (ITEM_FRAME)
- Slot 15: Delete Slot button (TNT)
- Slot 22: Back button (ARROW)

Click Detection:
- Left-click: Normal behavior (switch/create)
- Right-click: Opens settings GUI
- Both work independently

Error Handling:
- Empty slots: Cannot open settings
- Locked slots: Cannot open settings
- Only slots with islands can open settings

=================================================
HOW IT WORKS
=================================================

1. Player runs: /islandselector slots
2. Slot Selection GUI opens
3. Player RIGHT-CLICKS on slot 1
4. Click type detected (RIGHT vs LEFT)
5. System checks:
   - Is slot locked? → Error
   - Is slot empty? → Error
   - Has island? → Open settings
6. SlotSettingsGUI opens
7. Shows:
   - Slot preview (center)
   - Rename button (left)
   - Change Icon button (middle)
   - Delete button (right)
   - Back button (bottom)
8. Player clicks a button
9. GUI closes, command instructions shown
10. Player uses command to make changes

Example Flow:
- Right-click slot 1
- Settings GUI opens
- Click "Rename" button
- See: "Use command: /islandselector setname 1 <name>"
- Run: /islandselector setname 1 My Base
- Slot renamed!

=================================================
COMPARISON TO EXISTING FEATURES
=================================================

Before Session 31:
- Only left-click worked in slot GUI
- Had to remember commands for slot management
- No quick access to slot settings

After Session 31:
- Right-click opens settings menu
- Visual buttons for all slot features
- Command instructions shown on-demand
- Quick access without memorizing commands
- Intuitive GUI-based workflow

Benefits:
✓ More discoverable (players find features)
✓ Less memorization required
✓ Visual feedback for available actions
✓ Consistent with modern game UX
✓ Faster workflow (fewer steps)

=================================================
TESTING PRIORITY
=================================================

HIGH Priority:
1. Right-click opens settings GUI (Test #88)
2. Preview shows correctly (Test #89)
3. Back button works
4. No console errors

MEDIUM Priority:
5. Rename button correct (Test #90)
6. Change Icon button correct (Test #91)
7. Delete button visible
8. Command instructions accurate

LOW Priority:
9. Edge cases (empty, locked)
10. Multiple slots
11. Performance (rapid opening)
12. Visual polish

=================================================
INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING FEATURES
=================================================

Commands Still Work:
- /islandselector setname <slot> <name>
- /islandselector seticon <slot>
- /islandselector delete <slot>

Settings GUI Complements:
- Shows which commands to use
- Provides examples
- Quick reference
- Doesn't replace commands
- Adds convenience layer

Design Philosophy:
- GUI for discovery and guidance
- Commands for actual changes
- Best of both worlds
- Maintains flexibility
- User-friendly workflow

=================================================
NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING
=================================================

If tests PASS:
- Report success
- Tests #88-91 marked as verified
- Recommended next features:
  1. Delete slot button in settings (Test #92)
  2. Slot cooldown display (Tests #84-87)
  3. Admin backup commands (Tests #114-117)
  4. Island relocation (Tests #122-132)

If tests FAIL:
- Report specific failures
- Developer will fix issues
- Re-build and re-test
- Don't proceed to new features

Strategic Notes:
- Settings GUI is foundation for future features
- May add more buttons later (teleport, info, etc.)
- Right-click pattern can extend to other GUIs
- Good UX improvement for discoverability

=================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
=================================================

Issue: Right-click doesn't open settings
Fix: Check server version, ensure ClickType.RIGHT supported

Issue: Settings show wrong slot data
Fix: Verify SlotData passed correctly, check database

Issue: Buttons not clickable
Fix: Check event listener registration, verify slot numbers

Issue: Console errors about listeners
Fix: Check HandlerList.unregisterAll() on close

Issue: Memory leaks
Fix: Test rapid opening/closing, check listener cleanup

Issue: GUI not closing
Fix: Verify closeInventory() called, check event handling

=================================================
PERFORMANCE NOTES
=================================================

Expected Performance:
- GUI opens instantly (<50ms)
- No lag on right-click
- Smooth back button navigation
- No memory accumulation

Test Method:
1. Open settings 20 times
2. Check server TPS (/tps)
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Verify no lag spikes

Red Flags:
- Lag when opening settings
- TPS drops below 19
- Memory usage increases over time
- Console spam

=================================================
VISUAL EXAMPLES
=================================================

Slot Selection GUI (before right-click):
[Slot 1] [Slot 2] [Slot 3] [Slot 4] [Slot 5]
   ↑
Right-click here

Settings GUI (after right-click):
Row 1:  [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [PREVIEW] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ]
