=================================================
SESSION 20 - CODE REVIEW & TESTING READINESS
=================================================

Session Date: Session 20
Agent Role: Code review, build verification, testing preparation

=================================================
SESSION 20 OVERVIEW
=================================================

**Purpose:** This session did NOT implement new features. Instead, it:
1. Reviewed the entire codebase to understand current state
2. Verified all previous implementations still compile successfully
3. Confirmed testing documentation is complete and accurate
4. Created clear documentation for the human tester

**Key Finding:** Tests #46-74 were already fully implemented in Sessions 6-18
but the autonomous agent wasn't aware of this due to new context window.

=================================================
WORK COMPLETED - SESSION 20
=================================================

✅ 1. COMPREHENSIVE CODE REVIEW
   - Reviewed all 27 Java source files
   - Verified IslandCreateListener implementation (Test #46)
   - Verified IslandClaimGUI implementation (Test #47)
   - Verified ConfirmationGUI implementation (Tests #48-49)
   - Verified BlueprintSelectionGUI exists
   - Verified grid coordinate mapping (Tests #50-52)
   - Verified location validation (Tests #54-55)
   - Verified premium purchases (Tests #56-57)
   - Verified slot system UI (Tests #58-63)
   - Verified FAWE slot switching (Tests #64-70)
   - Verified visitor teleportation (Tests #71-74)

✅ 2. BUILD VERIFICATION
   - Ran: ./init.sh
   - Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Source Files: 27 (unchanged from Session 19)
   - JAR Size: 128K (unchanged from Session 19)
   - Errors: 0
   - Warnings: 1 (deprecated API in SlotSwitchManager - non-critical)
   - Output: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

✅ 3. TESTING DOCUMENTATION REVIEW
   - Verified TESTING_SESSION10.md through TESTING_SESSION19.md
   - Total: 9 comprehensive testing documents covering all 35 pending tests

✅ 4. CREATED HUMAN TESTER GUIDE
   - File: SESSION20_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.txt
   - Comprehensive testing instructions
   - Quick start guide
   - Test coverage breakdown

=================================================
NO CODE CHANGES IN SESSION 20
=================================================

**New Files:**
- SESSION20_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.txt (documentation only)
- SESSION20_NOTES.txt (this file)

**Modified Files:** None (will update claude-progress.txt)

**Build Output:** Same as Session 19 (128K, no changes)

This was a pure review and documentation session.

=================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR HUMAN TESTER
=================================================

**PRIORITY 1: MANUAL TESTING**

The human tester should:
1. Install: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
2. Quick verification (4 commands):
   - /islandselector admin version
   - /islandselector
   - /island
   - /islandselector slots
3. Detailed testing using TESTING_SESSION*.md files
4. Report results in TESTER_FEEDBACK_SESSION20.txt

=================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENT (Session 21+)
=================================================

**If Tests Pass:**
- Mark tests as passing in feature_list.json
- Proceed to implement Tests #75+ (Advanced slot features, relocation, etc.)

**If Tests Fail:**
- Read tester feedback
- Fix all reported issues BEFORE implementing new features
- Re-build and ask for re-testing
- Iterate until all implemented features pass

=================================================
