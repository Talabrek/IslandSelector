SESSION 23 - READY FOR MANUAL TESTING
=================================================

**Session:** 23
**Date:** Session 23
**Agent Role:** Autonomous Feature Implementation
**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**New Features:** 3 (Tests #78-80)

=================================================
WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED
=================================================

Session 23 implemented the grid expansion system - a critical feature for server growth:

### Tests #78-80: Dynamic Grid Expansion

**Feature:** Admin commands to expand the grid boundaries in any direction

**Commands:**
- `/islandselector admin expand east <amount>` - Add columns to the east
- `/islandselector admin expand south <amount>` - Add rows to the south
- `/islandselector admin expand west <amount>` - Add columns to the west
- `/islandselector admin expand north <amount>` - Add rows to the north

**Why This Matters:**
- Servers can start with a small grid (e.g., 10x10)
- Expand as player base grows
- No need to pre-allocate huge areas
- Prevents wasted world generation
- Critical for organic server growth

**What Changed:**
- New AdminExpandCommand with full direction support
- Grid boundaries updated dynamically
- Changes persist to config.yml immediately
- GridManager automatically uses new boundaries

=================================================
QUICK START TESTING
=================================================

**Step 1: Install the JAR**
```
Copy: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
To:   plugins/BentoBox/addons/IslandSelector.jar
Restart server
```

**Step 2: Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check current grid size
/islandselector admin version
# Expected: Grid Size: 21x21 (default: -10 to 10)

# Expand east by 5 columns
/islandselector admin expand east 5
# Expected: "Expanded grid east by 5 - New size: 26x21"

# Open GUI and verify
/islandselector
# Scroll right - new eastern columns should be available (green glass)

# Expand south by 3 rows
/islandselector admin expand south 3
# Expected: "Expanded grid south by 3 - New size: 26x24"

# Scroll down - new southern rows should be available

# Check config.yml
# Navigate to plugins/IslandSelector/config.yml
# Verify: max-x: 15 (was 10), max-z: 13 (was 10)

# Restart server
stop
# Start server again

# Verify persistence
/islandselector admin version
# Expected: Grid Size: 26x24 (persisted!)

# Open GUI - expanded areas should still be available
/islandselector
```

If all steps work, Tests #78, #79, and #80 pass! ✅

**Step 3: Detailed Testing (optional)**
See `TESTING_SESSION23.md` for:
- All 4 directions (north/south/east/west)
- Edge case testing (invalid input, zero amount, etc.)
- Full scenario walkthrough
- Troubleshooting guide

=================================================
BUILD INFORMATION
=================================================

**JAR Location:** `output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
**JAR Size:** 132K (unchanged)
**Source Files:** 30 (+1 new: AdminExpandCommand.java)
**Compilation:** ✅ SUCCESS (0 errors, 1 non-critical warning)

**Files Modified:**
- AdminExpandCommand.java (NEW - 96 lines)
- AdminCommand.java (+1 line - registered expand command)
- IslandSelector.java (+11 lines - added saveSettings method)
- en-US.yml (+6 lines - expand command messages)
- TESTING_SESSION23.md (NEW - comprehensive test guide)
- TESTING.md (updated - session 23 reference)

=================================================
TESTING PRIORITY
=================================================

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Test #78: Expand grid east adds columns
- Test #79: All directions (north/south/east/west) work
- Test #80: Config persistence across restart

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- Can create islands in expanded areas
- Expanded areas show as available (not locked)
- Error messages for invalid input

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- Very large expansions (100+ in each direction)
- Multiple expansions in same direction
- Expansion with existing islands at boundaries

=================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS
=================================================

**Test #78 - Expand East:**
✅ Command succeeds with correct message
✅ Config.yml max-x value increases
✅ GUI shows new eastern columns as green glass (available)
✅ Can scroll to new columns
✅ Can create islands in expanded area

**Test #79 - All Directions:**
✅ South: increases max-z (rows added at bottom)
✅ North: decreases min-z (rows added at top)
✅ East: increases max-x (columns added at right)
✅ West: decreases min-x (columns added at left)
✅ All show correct new grid size

**Test #80 - Config Persistence:**
✅ Config.yml updates immediately
✅ Grid boundaries persist after restart
✅ Expanded areas remain available after restart
✅ No data loss or corruption

=================================================
ERROR HANDLING TO TEST
=================================================

```bash
# Invalid direction
/islandselector admin expand northeast 5
# Expected: "Invalid direction: northeast. Use: north, south, east, or west"

# Invalid amount (negative)
/islandselector admin expand east -5
# Expected: "Invalid amount: -5. Must be a positive number."

# Invalid amount (not a number)
/islandselector admin expand east abc
# Expected: "Invalid amount: abc. Must be a positive number."

# Missing arguments
/islandselector admin expand
# Expected: Shows help/usage message
```

=================================================
REGRESSION TESTING
=================================================

After testing expansion, verify these still work:
- ✅ `/islandselector` - GUI opens
- ✅ `/islandselector admin reserve 0,0` - Reserve works
- ✅ `/islandselector admin setprice 1,1 1000` - Set price works
- ✅ `/islandselector admin info 0,0` - Info command works
- ✅ `/islandselector admin version` - Shows correct grid size
- ✅ Island creation in original (non-expanded) areas
- ✅ Grid scrolling in all directions

=================================================
REPORTING RESULTS
=================================================

**If ALL 3 tests pass:**
Reply with:
- "✅ Test #78 PASS - Expand east works"
- "✅ Test #79 PASS - All directions work"
- "✅ Test #80 PASS - Config persistence works"

I'll mark them as passing in feature_list.json and continue with new features.

**If ANY test fails:**
Create a file: `TESTER_FEEDBACK_SESSION23.txt` with:
- Which test failed (#78, #79, or #80)
- What command was run
- What went wrong (error message, unexpected behavior)
- Console errors (if any)
- Config.yml contents (grid section)
- Steps to reproduce

I'll fix the issues before implementing new features.

=================================================
CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION
=================================================

**Current Progress:**
- 44/225 tests verified and passing (19.6%)
- 41/225 tests implemented, pending testing (18.2%)
  - Includes 3 new from Session 23
- 140/225 tests not yet implemented (62.2%)

**Next Features (Session 24+):**
If Tests #78-80 pass, the next session will likely implement:
- Grid shrink command (remove empty areas)
- More admin tools
- Additional slot system features
- Or next highest priority from feature_list.json

**Backlog:**
Still 38 tests from Sessions 6-22 awaiting manual verification.
Recommendation: Test in batches when convenient.

=================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
=================================================

**Grid Coordinate System:**
- Centered at (0,0)
- Supports negative coordinates
- Default: -10 to 10 (21x21)
- Width = maxX - minX + 1
- Height = maxZ - minZ + 1

**Direction Mapping:**
- East = positive X (increases maxX)
- West = negative X (decreases minX)
- South = positive Z (increases maxZ)
- North = negative Z (decreases minZ)

**Config Structure:**
```yaml
grid:
  min-x: -10  # Western boundary
  max-x: 10   # Eastern boundary
  min-z: -10  # Northern boundary
  max-z: 10   # Southern boundary
```

**How It Works:**
1. Admin runs expand command
2. Settings boundaries updated
3. saveSettings() writes to config.yml
4. GridManager.isWithinBounds() uses new values
5. GUI automatically shows expanded areas
6. No server restart required (but persists across restarts)

=================================================

1. Check `TESTING_SESSION23.md` for comprehensive guide
2. Check `SESSION23_NOTES.txt` for implementation details
3. Check console logs for errors
4. Leave notes in `TESTER_FEEDBACK_SESSION23.txt`
