SESSION 18 - READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING
=================================================

Hi Human Tester!

Session 18 is complete. This was a documentation and consolidation session
with NO new code written. Instead, I reviewed all previous implementations
and created comprehensive testing documentation.

=================================================
WHAT HAPPENED IN SESSION 18
=================================================

✅ Reviewed all Sessions 6-17 implementations
✅ Verified Test #40 (premium tooltips) is fully implemented
✅ Created detailed testing guide for 34 tests
✅ Organized tests by priority and complexity
✅ Build verified: SUCCESS (120K JAR)

**No code changes were made** - only documentation.

=================================================
IMPORTANT: 34 TESTS READY FOR TESTING
=================================================

I discovered that Tests #28-74 are ALL fully implemented but haven't
been manually verified yet. That's 34 tests ready for you to test!

These tests cover:

- Copy to: plugins/BentoBox/addons/
- Restart server

=================================================
HOW TO REPORT RESULTS
=================================================

For each test, please report:

**If test PASSES:**
```
Test #40: PASS ✅
- Premium tooltip displays correctly
- Price shows as $50,000 with commas
- All expected elements present
```

**If test FAILS:**
```
Test #42: FAIL ❌
- Expected: Confirmation GUI opens when clicking empty location
- Actual: Nothing happens, no GUI shown
- Console error: NullPointerException in GridGUIListener.java:145
- Screenshot: [attach if helpful]
```

**Report format:**
- Test number
- PASS or FAIL
- Brief notes
- Console errors (full stack trace if available)
- Screenshots for visual issues

=================================================
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TESTING
=================================================

**If bugs found:**
The next development session will fix all reported bugs before
implementing new features.

**If all tests pass:**
The next development session will implement the next batch of
features from the app spec:
- Island Relocation (Tests #75-90)
- Visit/Warp system (Tests #91-100)
- Neighborhood enhancements (Tests #101-110)
- And more...

**Why wait for testing?**
We have 34 tests implemented. It's better to verify these work
correctly before building more features on top of them. If there
are bugs, we fix them now while the code is fresh.

=================================================
CURRENT PROGRESS
=================================================

Tests Passing (verified): 44/225 (19.6%)
Tests Implemented (pending): 34/225 (15.1%)
Tests Not Implemented: 147/225 (65.3%)

**Total Implemented:** 78/225 (34.7%)

After you verify Tests #28-74, we'll have:
- Either 78 passing tests (if all pass)
- Or fixes to make + re-verification

=================================================
QUESTIONS?
=================================================

If anything is unclear:
1. Check TESTING_SESSION18.md for detailed instructions
2. Check the source code (references provided in guide)
3. Check console for errors
4. Report the issue with as much detail as possible

=================================================
TEST #40 - QUICK START EXAMPLE
=================================================

Want to verify the testing setup works? Try Test #40 first:

**Test #40: Premium Location Tooltips**

1. Start your test server with IslandSelector installed
2. Join as admin player
3. Run: `/islandselector admin setprice D4 50000`
4. Run: `/islandselector`
5. Find location D4 in the grid (gold block icon)
6. Hover your mouse over the D4 slot
7. Verify tooltip shows:
   - "⭐ Premium Location: D4"
   - "Location: X: [number], Z: [number]"
   - "Price: $50,000" (with comma!)
   - "Click to purchase"

**Expected result:** All tooltip elements present with correct formatting

**If it works:** Test #40 passes! ✅ Move on to the next tests.

**If it doesn't work:** Report what you see vs what's expected.

=================================================
THANK YOU!
=================================================

Your testing helps ensure this plugin works correctly on real Minecraft
servers with real players. The development sessions implement features,
but you verify they actually work!

Take your time, test thoroughly, and report everything you find.

Happy testing! 🎮
