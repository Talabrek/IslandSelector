## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Gaps | Tech Debt |
|-------|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| 5. Config Toggle | PASSED | 4/4 | 0 | 0 |

## Integration Verification

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| Export | Source | Consumers | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| `isSlotsEnabled()` | Settings.java:342 | SlotsCommand, MainGridGUI, SharedGridGUIListener | CONNECTED |
| `/map` alias | IslandSelectorCommand.java:20 | BentoBox CompositeCommand routing | CONNECTED |
| Clean codebase | Phase 7 deletions | N/A - removal phase | CLEAN |

### File Overlap Analysis

Three files were modified by multiple phases. No conflicts detected:

| File | Phase 5 | Phase 6 | Phase 7 | Conflict |
|------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| IslandSelectorCommand.java | - | Added alias | Removed NeighborsCommand | None |
| MainGridGUI.java | Slot button check | - | Removed neighborhood button | None |
| SharedGridGUIListener.java | Slot click check | - | Removed neighborhood handler | None |

### E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Slot Toggle | Config -> Settings -> Command/GUI checks | COMPLETE |
| /map Alias | Command -> BentoBox routing -> GUI opens | COMPLETE |
| Neighbors Removed | Files deleted -> No orphans | COMPLETE |

## Build Verification

```
mvn clean package -q
```

**Result:** SUCCESS - `IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` produced

## Human Verification Checklist

The following items require manual testing on a Minecraft server:

### Phase 5 (Config Toggle)
- [ ] Set `slots.enabled: false`, run `/islandselector slots` -> Shows disabled message
- [ ] Set `slots.enabled: false`, open main GUI -> No slots button at slot 50
- [ ] Set `slots.enabled: true` -> Slots button appears, command works

### Phase 6 (Command Alias)
- [ ] Run `/map` -> Island selector GUI opens
- [ ] Run `/map slots` -> Slot selection GUI opens
- [ ] Tab complete `/map ` -> Shows same subcommands as `/islandselector`

### Phase 7 (Neighbors Removal)
- [ ] Open main GUI -> No neighbors button at slot 49
- [ ] Run `/islandselector neighbors` -> Unknown command error

## Summary

**Milestone v1.1 Simplification is complete.**

- All 9 requirements satisfied
- All 3 phases passed verification
- All cross-phase integrations verified
- Build succeeds
- No tech debt accumulated

The addon now has:
1. Configurable slot system (can be disabled via `slots.enabled: false`)
2. `/map` command alias for convenience
3. Neighbors feature cleanly removed (placeholder for adjacent players kept)
