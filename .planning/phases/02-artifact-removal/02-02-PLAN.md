Delete backup Java files from generations/island_selector/:

1. Delete backup Java files (3 files):
   - MainGridGUI_backup.java (828 lines - current version has 996 lines)
   - GridManager_backup.java (638 lines - current version has 821 lines)
   - NeighborhoodGUI_backup_session44.java (455 lines - current version has 512 lines)

   Pattern: generations/island_selector/*_backup*.java

2. Delete shell scripts (3 files):
   - init.sh
   - find_next_test.sh
   - update_testing.sh

   Pattern: generations/island_selector/*.sh

All files are untracked - use regular rm, not git rm.

IMPORTANT: Only delete files matching *_backup*.java pattern, NOT regular .java files.

Delete miscellaneous development files:

1. Delete misc files in generations/island_selector/:
   - app_spec.txt (app specification)
   - feature_list.json (feature list)
   - .claude_settings.json (Claude config)

2. Delete doc backup files in generations/island_selector/:
   - TESTING.md.backup
   - TESTING.md.session40.backup
   Pattern: generations/island_selector/*.backup

3. Delete nested .backup files in src/ tree:
   - src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/commands/IslandSelectorCommand.java.backup
   - src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/commands/AdminCommand.java.backup
   - src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/IslandSelector.java.backup

   Use find command to locate all .backup files recursively:
   `find generations/island_selector/src -name "*.backup" -delete`

4. Delete output/ folder (contains build artifact JAR):
   - generations/island_selector/output/
   Use: rm -rf generations/island_selector/output

5. Delete Windows artifact file from root:
   - nul (0-byte Windows artifact file)

All files are untracked - use regular rm/rm -rf, not git rm.

Complete artifact cleanup verification:

1. Search for backup Java files:
   `find . -name "*backup*.java" -not -path "./.git/*" 2>/dev/null`
   Expected: No output

2. Search for any .backup files:
   `find . -name "*.backup" -not -path "./.git/*" 2>/dev/null`
   Expected: No output

3. Search for shell scripts in generations/:
   `find generations -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null`
   Expected: No output

4. Verify misc files removed:
   `ls generations/island_selector/app_spec.txt generations/island_selector/feature_list.json 2>/dev/null`
   Expected: No output (files not found)

5. Verify output folder removed:
   `test -d generations/island_selector/output && echo FAIL || echo PASS`
   Expected: PASS
