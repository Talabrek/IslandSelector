# Requirements: IslandSelector v1.1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-20
**Core Value:** Players can visually select their island location from a grid-based GUI

## v1.1.1 Requirements

Bugfix patch release. All requirements are defect corrections.

### Level Display

- [x] **LEVL-01**: Island level in GUI matches `/island level` command output exactly
- [x] **LEVL-02**: Level updates reflect immediately (no stale cached values)

### Island Visiting

- [x] **VIST-01**: Right-clicking an island only teleports if owner has active warp sign
- [x] **VIST-02**: GUI hides "Right-click to visit" hint when island has no warp sign
- [x] **VIST-03**: GUI shows warp availability indicator (✓ has warp / no indicator if none)
- [x] **VIST-04**: Clicking island without warp shows "This island doesn't have a warp" message

### Relocation Safety

- [x] **RELC-01**: Relocation only teleports players who were actually on the old island location
- [x] **RELC-02**: Players elsewhere in the world are not affected by relocation

## Future Requirements
