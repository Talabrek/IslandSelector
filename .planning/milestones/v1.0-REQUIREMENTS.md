## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Modifying Java source code | Cleanup only, no logic changes |
| Adding new features | Not part of cleanup scope |
| Changing build configuration | Just moving pom.xml, not editing it |
| Creating documentation | Focus on file cleanup only |
