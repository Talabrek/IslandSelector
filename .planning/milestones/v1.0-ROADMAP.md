# Milestone v1.0: IslandSelector Cleanup

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

This cleanup transforms a cluttered BentoBox addon project into a standard Maven structure. The work flows through four phases: consolidate the nested git repository, remove development artifacts (Python scripts, backups), move essential files to the project root, and verify the build works. Each phase depends on the previous one completing successfully.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Git Repository Consolidation

**Goal**: Single clean git repository at project root with consolidated import commit
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: GIT-01, GIT-02, GIT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `git log` from project root shows the full development history
  2. No `.git` folder exists inside `generations/island_selector/`
  3. `git status` works correctly and shows clean state (or expected pending changes)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Delete nested .git and commit files to root repository

### Phase 2: Artifact Removal

**Goal**: Project contains only essential Java source and resources
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: REM-01, REM-02, REM-03, REM-04, REM-05, REM-06, REM-07, REM-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No Python files (*.py) exist anywhere in the project
  2. No backup Java files (*_backup*.java) exist anywhere in the project
  3. No `__pycache__/`, `prompts/`, or other development artifact folders exist
  4. Only Java source files, Maven config, and documentation remain
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - Delete Python files and related artifacts (root + generations/)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Delete backup files, shell scripts, and misc development debris

### Phase 3: Project Restructure

**Goal**: Standard Maven project structure at repository root
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: MOV-01, MOV-02, MOV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `src/` directory exists directly under project root
  2. `pom.xml` exists directly under project root
  3. `generations/` folder no longer exists (empty after moves)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Move Maven project files to root and clean up empty directories

### Phase 4: Build Verification

**Goal**: Confirmed working Maven project ready for development
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: VER-01, VER-02, VER-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `mvn clean compile` succeeds without errors
  2. All 85 Java source files are present in `src/`
  3. Resource files (addon.yml, config.yml, en-US.yml) are present
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Verify build and file integrity

## Progress

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Git Repository Consolidation | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-01-20 |
| 2. Artifact Removal | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-01-20 |
| 3. Project Restructure | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-01-20 |
| 4. Build Verification | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-01-20 |

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Modified .gitignore to track generations/island_selector/ (required to unblock import)
- Combined nested .git deletion + import into single commit
- Used git mv for all file moves (preserves history)
- Replaced agent README entirely with IslandSelector README
- Used inner .gitignore as-is (comprehensive Java/Maven patterns)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Nested git repository causing confusion
- Python scripts and backup files cluttering project
- Non-standard project structure (src/ buried under generations/)

**Issues Deferred:**

- None - all cleanup requirements completed

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- EntityStorage.java uses deprecated API (warning only, not blocking)
- `nul` Windows artifact file exists at root (gitignored, 0 bytes)
