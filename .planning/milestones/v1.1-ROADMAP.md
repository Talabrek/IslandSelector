# Milestone v1.1: Simplification

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 5-7
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Streamline the addon by adding slot system configurability, command alias, and removing unused neighbors feature.

## Phases

### Phase 5: Config Toggle

**Goal**: Server admins can enable/disable the slot system via configuration
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements**: SLOT-01, SLOT-02, SLOT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Config file contains `slots.enabled` option with default `true`
  2. When `slots.enabled: false`, running `/islandselector slots` shows disabled message
  3. When `slots.enabled: false`, slots button does not appear in main GUI
  4. When `slots.enabled: true`, existing slot functionality works unchanged
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md - Add slots.enabled config toggle with command/GUI checks

### Phase 6: Command Alias

**Goal**: Players can use `/map` as a shortcut for `/islandselector`
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 5)
**Requirements**: CMD-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `/map` opens the island selector GUI
  2. Running `/map` with any subcommand works identically to `/islandselector`
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md - Add /map command alias to IslandSelectorCommand constructor

### Phase 7: Neighbors Removal

**Goal**: Neighbors feature is completely removed from the addon
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phases 5-6)
**Requirements**: REM-01, REM-02, REM-03, REM-04, REM-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Main GUI does not show neighbors button
  2. Running `/islandselector neighbors` returns unknown command error
  3. No neighbors-related permissions exist in addon.yml
  4. No orphaned neighbors locale keys cleaned up
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md - Delete neighbors source files and remove all references

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Default slotsEnabled to true for backward compatibility
- Added map as fourth alias parameter (after is, isgrid)
- Keep neighbors_online placeholder (useful for scoreboards independently of GUI)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Slot system can now be disabled without code changes
- Shorter command for players (/map vs /islandselector)
- Removed unused neighborhood feature (559 lines deleted)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
