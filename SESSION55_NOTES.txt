   - PlaceholderAPIIntegration: All 5 placeholders implemented
   - AdminUnreserveCommand: Properly unreserves locations
   - AdminClearPriceCommand: Removes price from reserved locations
   - All admin subcommands properly registered in AdminCommand

3. CREATED COMPREHENSIVE TESTING GUIDE
   - SESSION55_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.md created
   - Includes command reference, placeholder list, test priorities
   - Documents all implemented features

4. BUILD VERIFICATION
   - Build: SUCCESS (no errors)
   - JAR Size: 216K
   - Source Files: 54 Java files
   - Only minor deprecation warnings (cosmetic)

=================================================

  - Neighborhood GUI with neighbor warping
  - 14 admin commands (all subcommands)
  - PlaceholderAPI integration (5 placeholders)
  - Tab completion for all commands
  - Custom events (GridLocationClaimEvent, SlotSwitchEvent, IslandRelocateEvent)

FEATURES VERIFIED:
  - AdminVersionCommand shows BentoBox, BSkyBlock, FAWE versions
  - AdminVersionCommand shows optional deps (Vault, PAPI, Level)

THE BOTTLENECK IS HUMAN TESTER VERIFICATION

Most tests are fully implemented in code but marked as failing
because they haven't been manually verified on a Minecraft server.

If human tester verifies all sessions, we could reach:
- 44 (current) + 150+ (pending) = 194+ tests passing (86%+ complete!)

=================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS
=================================================

PRIORITY 1: Wait for Human Tester Feedback
  - Use SESSION55_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.md as comprehensive guide
  - Start with HIGH PRIORITY tests (Search, Premium, Claiming)
  - Work through MEDIUM PRIORITY (Slot Management)
  - Finish with LOWER PRIORITY (Admin Commands)

PRIORITY 2: Bug Fixes (if human tester reports issues)
  - Fix any reported bugs before implementing new features
  - Focus on user-facing functionality first
  - Update feature_list.json based on feedback

PRIORITY 3: Remaining Edge Cases (~31 tests)
  After human verification, remaining tests include:
  - Performance tests (large grids, async operations)
  - Compatibility tests (Paper/Spigot versions)
  - Edge case tests (disconnect during operation, server crash)
  - Multi-player concurrency tests
  - Economy edge cases

=================================================
SESSION 55 COMPLETE
=================================================

Status: CODEBASE REVIEW & DOCUMENTATION
Changes: 1 file created (SESSION55_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.md)
New Features: None (review session)
Tests Ready: 181 tests pending human verification
JAR: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (216K)

Result: Verified all core features are implemented
Significance: Clear path to 86%+ test completion with human verification
Next: Human tester verifies accumulated tests from Sessions 38-55
