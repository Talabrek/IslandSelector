=================================================
TESTING WORKFLOW FOR HUMAN TESTER
=================================================

**Step 1: Install the JAR**
```
Copy: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
To:   plugins/BentoBox/addons/IslandSelector.jar
```

**Step 2: Restart Server**
- Ensure BentoBox, BSkyBlock, and FAWE are installed
- Start the server and verify IslandSelector loads without errors

**Step 3: Run Through Tests**
- Start with Test #45 (quick sanity check)
- Then work through Tests #28-74 systematically
- Use the TESTING_SESSION*.md files for detailed steps

**Step 4: Report Results**
For each test, report:
- ✅ PASS: Feature works as specified
- ❌ FAIL: Feature doesn't work, describe issue
- ⚠️ PARTIAL: Feature partially works, describe what's wrong

**Step 5: Provide Feedback**
Create a file like `TESTER_FEEDBACK_SESSION20.txt` with:
- Which tests passed
- Which tests failed (with error details)
- Console errors or warnings
- Any unexpected behavior

=================================================
AFTER TESTING FEEDBACK
=================================================

**If Tests Pass:**
- Autonomous agent will mark them as passing in feature_list.json
- Continue implementing Tests #75+ (Island Relocation, etc.)

**If Tests Fail:**
- Autonomous agent will fix reported issues BEFORE implementing new features
- Re-test fixed features
- Iterate until all implemented features pass

=================================================
BUILD INFORMATION
=================================================

**Last Build:** Session 20
**JAR Location:** output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
**JAR Size:** 128K
**Source Files:** 27 Java files
**Compilation:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Warnings:** 1 (deprecated API in SlotSwitchManager - non-critical)

=================================================
QUICK START TESTING GUIDE
=================================================

**Fastest Way to Verify Plugin Works:**

1. Start server with JAR installed
2. Join as admin player
3. Run: `/islandselector admin version`
   - Should show plugin info (Test #45)
4. Run: `/islandselector`
   - Should open grid GUI (basic functionality)
5. Run: `/island`
   - Should intercept and show grid selection (Test #46)
6. Run: `/islandselector slots`
   - Should show slot selection GUI (Test #54)

If these 4 commands work, the plugin is functioning!
Then proceed with detailed testing of all 35 tests.

=================================================
DETAILED TESTING DOCUMENTATION
=================================================

Each session's testing file contains:
- Test number and description
- Step-by-step testing instructions
- Expected results
- Common issues to watch for

**Session-by-Session Test Coverage:**

| Session | Tests Implemented | Testing Doc |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| 10      | #28-35 (Search)  | TESTING_SESSION10.md |
| 11      | #40 (Premium)    | TESTING_SESSION11.md |
| 12      | #41-48 (Claiming)| TESTING_SESSION12.md |
| 13      | #49-53 (Validation)| TESTING_SESSION13.md |
| 14      | #54-63 (Slot UI) | TESTING_SESSION14.md |
| 15      | #64-70 (FAWE Switching)| TESTING_SESSION15.md |
| 16      | #71-74 (Visitors)| TESTING_SESSION16.md |
| 18      | (Documentation)  | TESTING_SESSION18.md (Consolidated) |
| 19      | #45 (Version Cmd)| TESTING_SESSION19.md |

**Recommended Order:**
1. Start with TESTING_SESSION19.md (simplest test)
2. Use TESTING_SESSION18.md as master reference (consolidates all)
3. Refer to individual session files for details

=================================================
KNOWN ISSUES & NOTES
=================================================

**Non-Critical Warnings:**
- SlotSwitchManager uses deprecated API (works but should be updated)
  - This doesn't affect functionality
  - Can be fixed in a future session

**Dependencies:**
- Required: BentoBox, BSkyBlock, FastAsyncWorldEdit
- Optional: Vault (for economy), PlaceholderAPI, Level addon
- Tests work with or without optional dependencies

**Testing Environment:**
- Paper/Spigot 1.20+
- Java 17+
- Fresh test world recommended for clean testing

=================================================
WHAT'S NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
=================================================

**Next Features to Implement (Tests #75+):**

1. **Advanced Slot Features** (Tests #75-90)
   - Slot renaming
   - Custom slot icons
   - Slot deletion
   - Slot cooldowns (beyond basic switching)

2. **Island Relocation** (Tests #91-110)
   - Moving existing islands to new grid locations
   - Relocation costs and permissions

3. **Visit/Warp System** (Tests #111-130)
   - Visiting other players' islands from grid
   - Public island warps

4. **Neighborhood View** (Tests #131-150)
   - 3x3 view of adjacent islands

5. **Level Integration** (Tests #151+)
   - Display island levels in grid GUI

These will be implemented AFTER the current 35 tests are verified by the human tester.

=================================================

=================================================

When providing feedback, please answer:

1. **Did the plugin load successfully?**
   - Any errors in console during startup?

2. **Which tests passed/failed?**
   - Use the test numbers (e.g., "Test #45 PASS", "Test #47 FAIL")

3. **For failing tests, what happened?**
   - Error messages?
   - Console errors?
   - Unexpected behavior?

4. **Are there any features that partially work?**
   - Some features might work in some scenarios but not others

5. **Any suggestions or observations?**
   - Performance issues?
   - Confusing UIs?
   - Missing quality-of-life features?

=================================================
CONTACT & FEEDBACK
=================================================

Provide feedback by:
- Creating `TESTER_FEEDBACK_SESSION20.txt` in this directory
- OR modifying feature_list.json to mark tests as passing/failing
- OR leaving notes in claude-progress.txt

The autonomous agent will read your feedback in the next session and:
- Fix any reported bugs
- Adjust implementations based on feedback
- Proceed with new features once existing tests pass

=================================================
SUMMARY
