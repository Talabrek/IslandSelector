SESSION 19 - READY FOR TESTING
=================================================

Hi Human Tester!

Session 19 is complete. I implemented Test #45: Admin version command
that displays comprehensive plugin and dependency information.

=================================================
WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED
=================================================

**Test #45: Admin Version Command**

Command: /islandselector admin version

This command shows:
- IslandSelector version
- BentoBox version
- BSkyBlock version (or "Not Found")
- FastAsyncWorldEdit version (or "Not Found")
- Optional dependency status:
  * Vault (economy features)
  * PlaceholderAPI (placeholder support)
  * Level addon (island level display)

Color-coded output:
- Green ✓ for installed dependencies
- Red ✗ for missing critical dependencies
- Gray - for optional dependencies not installed

=================================================
HOW TO TEST
=================================================

**Quick Test (2 minutes):**

1. Copy the new JAR to your server:
   - File: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (128K)
   - Destination: plugins/BentoBox/addons/

2. Restart your test server

3. Run the command (as admin or from console):
   /islandselector admin version

4. Verify the output shows all version information

5. Check console for any errors

**Expected Output:**
```
====================================
IslandSelector - Version Information
====================================

✓ IslandSelector: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
✓ BentoBox: [version number]
✓ BSkyBlock: [version number]
✓ FastAsyncWorldEdit: [version number]

Optional Dependencies:
✓ Vault: [version] (Economy features enabled)
✓ PlaceholderAPI: [version] (Placeholders enabled)
✓ Level: [version] (Level display enabled)

====================================
```

**If you don't have optional dependencies installed:**
They should show as "Not installed" with feature status disabled.

=================================================
DETAILED TESTING GUIDE
=================================================

For comprehensive test instructions, see:
📋 TESTING_SESSION19.md

This includes:
- Complete test steps
- Expected output variations
- Test with/without optional dependencies
- Console and in-game testing
- Troubleshooting common issues

=================================================
WHAT TO REPORT
=================================================

**If Test Passes:**
```
Test #45: PASS ✅
- All versions displayed correctly
- Optional dependencies shown correctly
- No console errors
```

**If Test Fails:**
```
Test #45: FAIL ❌
- Expected: [what you expected to see]
- Actual: [what you actually saw]
- Console errors: [paste error stack trace]
- Screenshot: [attach if helpful]
```

Common issues to watch for:
- NullPointerException if plugin not found
- Version showing as "null" instead of version number
- Colors not rendering (showing raw &a codes)
- Missing sections in output

=================================================
PREVIOUS TESTS STILL PENDING
=================================================

Don't forget about the 34 tests from Sessions 6-18 that are also
ready for verification:

- Test #40: Premium location tooltips
- Tests #28-35: Search functionality
- Tests #41-48: Island claiming & coordinates
- Tests #49-53: Location validation & purchases
- Tests #54-63: Slot system UI
- Tests #64-70: FAWE slot switching
- Tests #71-74: Visitor teleportation

See TESTING_SESSION18.md for detailed instructions on those tests.

**Total tests ready for verification: 35**
(34 from previous sessions + 1 from Session 19)

=================================================
BUILD INFORMATION
=================================================

- Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- JAR Location: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- JAR Size: 128K (up from 120K in Session 18)
- Source Files: 27 (added AdminVersionCommand.java)
- Compilation Errors: 0
- Build Time: 3.7 seconds

Files created/modified:
- NEW: AdminVersionCommand.java (133 lines)
- MODIFIED: AdminCommand.java (registered new command)
- MODIFIED: en-US.yml (added locale string)

=================================================
TESTING PRIORITY
=================================================

**Recommended testing order:**

1. **Test #45 first** (2 minutes)
   - Quick verification of new admin version command
   - Easy to test, low complexity

2. **Then continue with Tests #28-74** (2-3 hours)
   - Work through TESTING_SESSION18.md guide
   - Test systematically by category

3. **Report all results**
   - Mark each test as PASS or FAIL
   - Note any bugs or unexpected behavior
   - Console errors with stack traces

=================================================
CURRENT PROGRESS
=================================================

After Session 19:
- Tests Passing (verified by you): 44/225 (19.6%)
- Tests Implemented (pending testing): 35/225 (15.6%)
- Tests Not Implemented: 146/225 (64.9%)

**Total Implemented: 79/225 (35.1%)**

Once you verify these 35 tests, we'll have either:
- 79 passing tests (if all pass), OR
- Bug reports to fix before continuing

=================================================
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
=================================================

After you test and report results:

**If bugs found:** Next session will fix reported bugs

**If all pass:** Next session will implement new features:
- PlaceholderAPI integration (natural follow-up to version command)
- Slot switch UI feedback (action bars, progress)
- Island relocation system
- Visit/warp functionality

=================================================
QUESTIONS OR ISSUES?
=================================================

If you encounter any problems:
1. Check TESTING_SESSION19.md for detailed instructions
2. Verify all required dependencies installed (BentoBox, BSkyBlock, FAWE)
3. Check server console for error messages
4. Report the issue with as much detail as possible

=================================================
THANK YOU!
=================================================

Your testing is crucial for ensuring this plugin works correctly
on real Minecraft servers. Take your time, test thoroughly, and
report everything you find.

The plugin is 35.1% implemented with solid foundations. Your
feedback helps ensure quality before we build more features.

Happy testing! 🎮
