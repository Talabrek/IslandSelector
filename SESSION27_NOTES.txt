=================================================
COMPLETED TASKS - SESSION 27
=================================================

✅ 1. IMPLEMENTED ADMIN RESET COOLDOWN COMMAND

   - File: src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/managers/SlotManager.java
   - Method: resetSwitchCooldown(UUID playerUUID)
   - Functionality: Sets lastSwitchTime to 0, expiring cooldown immediately
   - Lines: +11 lines (clean, focused method)

✅ 3. REGISTERED NEW COMMAND
   - File: src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/commands/AdminCommand.java
   - Added: new AdminResetCooldownCommand(this) to command registry
   - Lines: +1 line (proper registration)

✅ 4. LOCALE MESSAGES
   - File: src/main/resources/locales/en-US.yml
   - Added: 7 new messages for resetcooldown command
   - Messages: success-switch, success-relocate, success-all, invalid-type, player-not-found
   - Added: description and parameters help text

✅ 5. TAB COMPLETION
   - Arg 1: Online player names (autocomplete)
   - Arg 2: switch, relocate, all (type options)
   - Smart, user-friendly command interface

✅ 6. OFFLINE PLAYER SUPPORT
   - Uses: Bukkit.getOfflinePlayer(name)
   - Works: Both online and offline players
   - Admin Benefit: Can help players even when they're not online

✅ 7. BUILD VERIFICATION

✅ 8. TESTING DOCUMENTATION
   - Created: TESTING_SESSION27.md (comprehensive test guide)
   - Includes: Detailed steps for Test #93
   - Includes: Setup instructions, expected behavior, success criteria
   - Includes: Notes about Tests #94-95 (structure in place for future)

✅ 9. GIT COMMIT
   - Commit: 07db5dd
   - Message: Descriptive, includes all changes and context

=================================================
TESTS IMPLEMENTED - SESSION 27
=================================================

**Test #93: Admin reset cooldown command clears switch cooldown**
- Command: /islandselector admin resetcooldown <player> switch
- Functionality: Resets switch cooldown to 0, allowing immediate switching
- Works: Online and offline players
- Tab Completion: Player names and cooldown types
- Error Handling: Invalid types, permission checks
- Status: ⏳ AWAITING MANUAL TESTING

**Test #94: Admin reset cooldown relocate** (Structure in place)
- Command: /islandselector admin resetcooldown <player> relocate
- Status: Command accepts it, but relocation system not implemented yet
- Will work when relocation feature is added

**Test #95: Admin reset cooldown all** (Structure in place)
- Command: /islandselector admin resetcooldown <player> all
- Status: Currently resets switch; will reset both when relocation exists

=================================================
KEY LEARNINGS - SESSION 27
=================================================

1. **Future-proofing commands:**
   - Implemented "relocate" and "all" options even though relocation isn't done
   - When relocation is implemented, just add one method call
   - Command structure won't need changes
   - Better UX: consistent command from day one

2. **Tab completion matters:**
   - Makes commands discoverable
   - Reduces typos and errors
   - Professional polish for admin commands
   - Easy to implement with tabComplete() override

3. **Offline player support is critical for admin commands:**
   - Support tickets often filed when player offline
   - Bukkit.getOfflinePlayer() returns player even if they've never joined
   - This is acceptable - operation is safe (just resets timestamp)
   - Better than blocking admins from helping offline players

4. **Cooldown storage design:**
   - Stored as timestamp (lastSwitchTime in SlotData)
   - Reset = set to 0 (epoch), not deletion
   - getRemainingCooldown() already handles 0 correctly
   - Clean, minimal code change required

5. **Locale message organization:**
   - Grouped under resetcooldown: block
   - success-switch, success-relocate, success-all (specific messages)
   - invalid-type, player-not-found (error messages)
   - Consistent with other admin commands

=================================================
SESSION 27 COMPLETE
=================================================

Work completed: Test #93 implementation (+structure for #94-95)
Type: Autonomous agent session (admin command)
Build status: ✅ SUCCESS
Testing status: ⏳ 1 NEW TEST READY FOR MANUAL TESTING (45 total pending)

Tests implemented this session: 1 (Test #93)
Tests passing: 44/225
Tests pending testing: 45/225
Tests remaining: 136/225

Progress: 39.6% implemented, 19.6% verified

**Session 27 Result:** Admins can now reset player cooldowns for support tickets and testing

**Feature Significance:** Quality-of-life improvement for server administration. Common support scenario: "I'm stuck on cooldown and need to switch slots!" - admin can now fix instantly with one command.

=================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENT (Session 28+)
=================================================

**If Test #93 Passes:**
- Mark as passing in feature_list.json
- Proceed to next unimplemented features
- Possible next targets:
  * More admin commands (Tests #88-92: purge player, purge inactive, purge banned)
  * PlaceholderAPI integration (Tests #96-100)
  * Slot management player commands (setname, seticon, delete)
  * Claiming system verification (Tests #46-49 may just need manual testing)

**If Test #93 Fails:**
- Read tester feedback carefully
- Fix reported issues
- Re-build and re-test
- Do NOT implement new features until this passes

**Strategy Recommendation:**
- Continue with admin commands (#88-92) - they're relatively simple and high-value
- Or switch to PlaceholderAPI (#96-100) - different domain, good for variety
- Save complex features (relocation, claiming edge cases) for later
- Build incrementally with testing feedback
