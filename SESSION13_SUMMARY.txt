PROJECT PROGRESS
=================================================

Total Tests: 225
Passing: 44 (unchanged - awaiting human tester)
Ready for Testing: 13 (Tests #49-61)
Pending Manual Test: Tests #36-48 from previous sessions
Remaining to Implement: 168

Completion: 19.6% passing, 25.3% ready for testing

=================================================
NEXT ACTIONS FOR HUMAN TESTER
=================================================

IMMEDIATE:
1. Copy JAR to test server: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
2. Install Vault + economy plugin (for Tests #51-53)
3. Follow TESTING_SESSION13.md for detailed test steps

PRIORITY TESTS:
- Test #53: Purchase bypass permission (NEW feature)
- Test #61: Locked slot error messages (ENHANCED)
- Tests #49-52: Location validation (verify existing)
- Tests #54-60: Slot UI elements (verify existing)

REGRESSION TESTS:
- Test #43: Island creation at correct coordinates
- Tests #36-39: Search functionality
- Test #40: Premium location tooltips

=================================================
NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
=================================================

1. Slot System Functionality (Tests #62-90)
   - Slot switching between islands
   - Island creation in empty slots
   - Schematic save/load with FAWE
   - Visitor handling during switches

2. Island Relocation (Tests #91-120)
   - Relocation GUI and flow
   - FAWE operations
   - Cost and cooldown handling

3. Advanced Features (Tests #121+)
   - PlaceholderAPI integration
   - Level addon integration
   - Neighborhood view
   - Performance optimizations

=================================================
KEY TAKEAWAYS
=================================================

✅ Always review existing code before implementing
✅ Permission-based bypasses are standard in Minecraft plugins
✅ Clear error messages improve user experience
✅ Small UI improvements matter (like the star character)
✅ Comprehensive documentation helps human testers

=================================================
SESSION 13 COMPLETE - AWAITING HUMAN TESTING
=================================================

The plugin is ready for the human tester to verify Tests #49-61.
All code compiles, JAR is built, documentation is complete.

Next autonomous session can continue with slot switching implementation
after human tester provides feedback on current features.
