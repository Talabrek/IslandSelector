SESSION 15 - READY FOR MANUAL TESTING
=================================================

👋 Hi Human Tester!

Session 15 is complete and ready for your testing on a Minecraft server.

=================================================
WHAT WAS BUILT IN THIS SESSION
=================================================

🎯 MAIN FEATURE: FAWE-Based Slot Switching

I implemented the complete slot switching system that allows players
to switch between their island slots with full schematic save/load.

How it works:
1. Player opens slot GUI (/islandselector slots)
2. Clicks on an inactive slot (slot with an island)
3. Confirmation GUI appears
4. Player clicks CONFIRM
5. Magic happens:
   - Current island saved to schematic file
   - World blocks cleared (set to air)
   - Target island schematic loaded to world
   - Player teleported to new island
   - Database updated
6. Player sees progress messages throughout

=================================================
⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
=================================================

**FastAsyncWorldEdit (FAWE) MUST be installed on the test server!**

Without FAWE, the slot switching will fail with errors.

You can download FAWE from:
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/

=================================================
WHAT TO TEST (Tests #64-70)
=================================================

See TESTING_SESSION15.md for detailed instructions.

Quick Test Flow:
1. Create an island, build something (house, farm, etc.)
2. Open slot GUI: /islandselector slots
3. Click empty slot #2, create second island
4. Build something different on slot 2
5. Switch back to slot 1 using slot GUI
6. Verify slot 1 island appears, slot 2 is saved
7. Switch to slot 2 again
8. Verify slot 2 island appears, slot 1 is saved

Expected Results:
✅ Schematic files created in: plugins/BentoBox/addons/IslandSelector/slots/<uuid>/
✅ Islands switch correctly, all blocks preserved
✅ Old island cleared from world when switching
✅ Player teleported to new island
✅ Progress messages shown during switch

=================================================
FILES TO COPY TO SERVER
=================================================

Copy this file to your test server:
📦 output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

To: plugins/BentoBox/addons/

Then restart the server.

=================================================
REGRESSION TESTING
=================================================

Please also verify these still work:
- Creating your first island (Tests #41-48)
- Opening the grid GUI (/islandselector)
- Opening the slot GUI (/islandselector slots)
- Admin commands (/islandselector admin info, etc.)

=================================================
