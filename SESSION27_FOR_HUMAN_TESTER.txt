SESSION 27 - QUICK START FOR HUMAN TESTER
====================================================================

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Test #93: Admin Reset Cooldown Command**

New admin command to reset player slot switch cooldowns:
```
/islandselector admin resetcooldown <player> <switch|relocate|all>
```

## Quick Test

1. **Copy the JAR:**
   - `target/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
   - To: `plugins/BentoBox/addons/`
   - Restart server

2. **Create a cooldown scenario:**
   ```
   - Join as test player
   - Create islands in slot 1 and slot 2
   - Switch from slot 1 to slot 2 (triggers cooldown)
   - Try to switch back immediately (should fail with cooldown error)
   ```

3. **Test the reset command:**
   ```
   /islandselector admin resetcooldown TestPlayer switch
   ```
   Expected: Green success message

4. **Verify cooldown is gone:**
   ```
   - As test player, switch slots again
   - Should succeed immediately (no cooldown)
   ```

5. **Test tab completion:**
   ```
   /islandselector admin resetcooldown <TAB>  (shows player names)
   /islandselector admin resetcooldown TestPlayer <TAB>  (shows: switch, relocate, all)
   ```

## What to Verify

✅ Command resets cooldown successfully
✅ Player can switch immediately after reset
✅ Works for online players
✅ Works for offline players
✅ Tab completion works
✅ Error handling (invalid type, wrong syntax)
✅ Permission check works
✅ No errors in console

## Permission

```yaml
islandselector.admin.resetcooldown
```

Or use the parent permission:
```yaml
islandselector.admin
```

## Full Testing Guide

See `TESTING_SESSION27.md` for comprehensive test steps.

## Command Variants

```bash
# Reset switch cooldown only
/islandselector admin resetcooldown PlayerName switch

# Reset relocation cooldown (structure in place for future)
/islandselector admin resetcooldown PlayerName relocate

# Reset all cooldowns
/islandselector admin resetcooldown PlayerName all
```

## Use Cases

This command is useful for:
- Support tickets: "I'm stuck on cooldown!"
- Testing slot switching functionality
- VIP perks (let donors switch without cooldown)
- Special events where cooldowns should be waived

## Notes

- Currently only "switch" does something (relocation not implemented yet)
- "relocate" and "all" options are there for future when relocation is added
- Command works for both online and offline players
- Safe to use - just resets a timestamp, doesn't modify island data
