SESSION 32 - FOR HUMAN TESTER
===============================================

**Session Type:** Discovery & Documentation (No new code)
**What Happened:** Found existing search feature, needs testing
**Your Action:** Test search functionality on server

===============================================
WHAT WAS DISCOVERED
===============================================

The SEARCH FEATURE is already fully implemented but has never
been tested on a Minecraft server!

**Search Features Found:**
✅ Search button (COMPASS) in grid GUI
✅ Chat-based player name input
✅ Exact and partial name matching
✅ Offline player search support
✅ Viewport centering on found islands
✅ Error handling for not found
✅ Search cancellation

**Code Quality:** EXCELLENT (zero bugs found in review)
**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Ready to Test:** YES

===============================================
QUICK TEST (5 MINUTES)
===============================================

1. **Install Plugin**
   - Copy: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   - To: plugins/BentoBox/addons/
   - Restart server

2. **Open Grid GUI**
   ```
   /islandselector
   ```

3. **Find Search Button**
   - Look in bottom row (row 6)
   - Slot 47 (third from left)
   - Should be a COMPASS item
   - Hover: "Search Player"

4. **Test Search**
   - Click the COMPASS
   - GUI closes, chat shows instructions
   - Type a player name who has an island
   - Press Enter
   - Should see: "Found [Name]'s island at X,Z!"
   - GUI reopens centered on their island

5. **Test Cancel**
   - Click COMPASS again
   - Type: cancel
   - GUI should reopen

6. **Test Not Found**
   - Click COMPASS
   - Type: FakePlayer999
   - Should see error: "Player not found..."
   - GUI reopens

**Expected Result:** All 6 steps work ✅

===============================================
WHAT TO TEST
===============================================

**Basic Functionality:**
- [ ] Search button appears (COMPASS in slot 47)
- [ ] Clicking it shows chat instructions
- [ ] Typing player name finds their island
- [ ] Viewport centers on found island
- [ ] Error message for player not found
- [ ] Can cancel with "cancel"

**Advanced Features:**
- [ ] Partial names work (e.g., "Not" finds "Notch")
- [ ] Offline player search works
- [ ] Search input is private (not broadcast)
- [ ] Multiple searches work in succession

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Player without island → Clear error
- [ ] Nonexistent player → Clear error
- [ ] Empty input → Graceful handling

===============================================
DETAILED TESTING GUIDE
===============================================

See: TESTING_SESSION32.md

Contains:
- 10 detailed test cases
- 5 edge case tests
- Integration tests
- Troubleshooting guide
- Full validation checklist

Estimated time: 25-30 minutes for full suite

===============================================
REPORTING RESULTS
===============================================

**If Everything Works:**
1. Note which test IDs correspond to search in feature_list.json
2. Mark those tests as "passes": true
3. Provide feedback that search is verified ✅

**If Something Doesn't Work:**
1. Note what failed (specific steps)
2. Include error messages from chat
3. Check server console for errors
4. Include screenshots if helpful
5. Next agent session will fix issues

===============================================
WHY THIS SESSION IS DIFFERENT
===============================================

Session 32 didn't implement new features.

Instead:
- Discovered existing implementation
- Reviewed code quality (EXCELLENT)
- Created testing documentation
- Prepared for verification

Sometimes the best session is documenting what's
already done!

===============================================
FILES CREATED THIS SESSION
===============================================

1. SESSION32_NOTES.txt (this file)
2. TESTING_SESSION32.md (comprehensive test guide)

No code changes - just documentation.

===============================================
WHAT'S NEXT
===============================================

**Your Job:** Test search on server
**Agent's Next Job:** Depends on your results

IF search works:
- Mark tests as passing
- Move to next unimplemented feature

IF search has issues:
- Fix reported bugs
- Re-test
- Then continue with new features

===============================================
QUICK REFERENCE
===============================================

**JAR Location:**
output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

**Test Command:**
/islandselector

**Search Button:**
COMPASS in slot 47 (bottom row, third from left)

**How to Search:**

===============================================
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH
===============================================

Code review shows:
✅ Clean architecture
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Privacy protection
✅ Good user experience
