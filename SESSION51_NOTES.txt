SESSION 51 - FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION (December 2, 2025)
=================================================

Session Date: Session 51
Agent Role: Feature Implementation - Neighbors Command

=================================================
COMPLETED TASKS - SESSION 51
=================================================

✅ 1. IMPLEMENTED /ISLANDSELECTOR NEIGHBORS COMMAND
   - Created: NeighborsCommand.java (NEW)
   - Command: /islandselector neighbors
   - Aliases: neighbours, neighbourhood, neighborhood
   - Opens Neighborhood GUI directly without going through grid GUI
   - Permission: islandselector.use (same as base command)

✅ 2. INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING COMMAND STRUCTURE
   - Added to IslandSelectorCommand.java
   - Registered as subcommand of /islandselector
   - Tab completion automatically works
   - Uses existing NeighborhoodGUI class

✅ 3. ERROR HANDLING
   - Checks if player has an island
   - Shows friendly error message if no island exists
   - Suggests using /island create

✅ 4. BUILD AND DOCUMENTATION
   - Plugin builds successfully (216K, up from 212K)
   - Created SESSION51_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.md (6 test cases)
   - Updated TESTING.md with Session 51 info
   - All changes compile cleanly

=================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================================================

**Command Implementation:**
- Extends CompositeCommand (BentoBox API)
- Uses GridManager to check for player's island
- Opens NeighborhoodGUI if island exists
- Friendly error message if no island

**Why This Was Needed:**
- Test at feature_list.json line 1632 requires:
  "Step 1: Create island and execute /islandselector neighbors"
- Previously, Neighborhood GUI was only accessible via button in grid GUI
- Now players can open it directly with a command

**Code Quality:**
- Clean, minimal implementation (46 lines)
- Follows existing command patterns
- Proper error handling
- Permission consistent with other player commands

=================================================
TESTS READY FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION
=================================================

**Session 51 Tests (6 new):**
1. Basic command opens Neighborhood GUI
2. Command aliases work (neighbours, neighbourhood, neighborhood)
3. Error message for player without island
4. Shows neighbors correctly (player heads)
5. Shows empty positions (green glass)
6. Tab completion includes "neighbors"

**This enables testing of:**
- Test line 1630: "Neighborhood GUI opens with 27 slots and 3x3 layout"
- Test line 1641: "Neighborhood GUI shows 8 surrounding neighbor positions"
- Test line 1652: "Neighborhood GUI shows online neighbor with player head"
- Test line 1664: "Neighborhood GUI shows offline neighbor with red glass"
- Test line 1675: "Neighborhood GUI shows empty adjacent locations with green glass"

=================================================
FILES CREATED/MODIFIED
=================================================

**Created:**
- src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/commands/NeighborsCommand.java (NEW - 46 lines)
- SESSION51_FOR_HUMAN_TESTER.md
- SESSION51_NOTES.txt (this file)

**Modified:**
- src/main/java/world/bentobox/islandselector/commands/IslandSelectorCommand.java (added NeighborsCommand)
- TESTING.md (added Session 51 info)

=================================================
BUILD INFO
=================================================

- JAR: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Size: 216K (+4K from Session 50)
- Source files: 53 (up from 52)
- Status: BUILD SUCCESS

=================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS
=================================================

PRIORITY 1: Wait for Human Tester Feedback
  - Total: 118+ tests pending (Sessions 38-51)
  - Session 51: 6 neighbors command tests
  - If all pass: Progress to ~50/225 (22.2% verified)

PRIORITY 2: Continue Testing Documentation
  - Many features are implemented but not yet documented
  - Focus on creating clear test guides for human tester
  - Prioritize core functionality tests

PRIORITY 3: Polish and Edge Cases
  - Look for any remaining unimplemented features
  - Focus on edge case handling
  - Performance testing

=================================================
SESSION 51 COMPLETE
=================================================

Status: ✅ SUCCESS
Changes: 1 command file created, 2 files modified
New Features: /islandselector neighbors command
Tests Ready: 6 tests
JAR: output/IslandSelector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (216K)

**Result:** Neighbors command enables direct access to Neighborhood GUI
**Significance:** Unlocks testing of all neighborhood-related tests
**Next:** Human tester verifies 118+ tests total (Sessions 38-51)
